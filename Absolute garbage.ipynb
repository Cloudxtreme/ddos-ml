The leaked files appear to contain audit information, work orders, user codes, neighborhood association data, and other details. \\nI ve tried to contact Lexington representatives to see if they re aware of the breach. Considering that the website itself hasn t been altered, it s possible that they don t know about the hack. I ll update this post if they respond to my inquiry. \\nMaxney is famous for leaking data from the websites of high-profile organizations. His latest targets have been Pizza Hut , Sony , and the US Air Force Culture and Language Center.
